This folder contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. (many have not been uploaded yet, will upload them soon)
I am currently also taking a Data Structures and Algorithms course on Coursera, hence I am using LeetCode to practice some of my newly learnt knowledge.
The course link is provided below: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms (enroll in each individual module instead of the entire specialisation to audit the course for free)
I am currently halfway through the third module. (4 modules in total)
Please do not copy anything from this folder for the completion of LeetCode assignments! At least try to do it yourself!
