# python-code
This repository contains most of the Python code that I have written recently. (code written in other languages have not been included)
It contains solutions to Problem Sets from some MOOCs (together with the original code provided by the course, if any).
It also contains solutions to LeetCode Problems, as I am currently taking an online Data Structures/Algorithms Course and need some practice. (Please let me know if there are better platforms for practice)
It also contains a few random small projects that I did for fun when I was bored.

**IMPORTANT**:
Code here SHOULD NOT be copied or plagiarised in any form, especially for the completion of MOOCs.
This repository will be locked and hidden from public very soon, once it has served its purpose.

I did not cheat or plagiarise any solutions online to finish these problems (a coding interview should be able to show how much I know)
