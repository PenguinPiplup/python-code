# math-game
I created this folder when I was halfway through CS50 Python.
This folder contains a random game (relatively simple one) that I created because I was getting a bit bored.
This game was modelled off an actual game that previously circulated on telegram.

To run this game, we run "python math_game.py" in the command prompt after changing directory to this folder.
We then try to answer as many questions correctly as possible. 
For each question, an equation will be shown and the user will have to determine whether the equation shown is correct or incorrect, as quickly as possible (within the given time limit).
As the user progresses through the levels, the time given for each question will decrease. Additionally, the levels will increase in difficulty. (More tricky questions shown)

Also, looking back, there are some things which I would change about the code after learning more about python.
