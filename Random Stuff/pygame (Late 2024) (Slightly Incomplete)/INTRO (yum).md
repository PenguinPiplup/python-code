# python-code
I created this folder when I was experimenting with pygame recently.
This folder contains a random game (relatively simple one) that I created because I was a bit bored.

To run this game, pygame must be downloaded via "pip install pygame" and we run "python pacman.py" in the command prompt after changing directory to the pygame folder.
We then try to move the pacman character to eat the yellow food. 
The speed of the pacman character will gradually increase as the score increases.

This game is slightly incomplete as I need to display the current score and level while the user is playing the game (but adding this should be quite fast).
